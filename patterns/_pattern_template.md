# Pattern: Pattern Name

### Context:
You are an experienced practitioner in your field. You have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a commonly occurring problem. You would like to share your experience with others.

### Problem:
How do you share a recurring solution to a problem with others so that it may be reused?

### Forces:
- Keeping the solution to yourself doesn't require any effort
- Sharing the solution verbally helps a few others but won't make a big impact in your field.
- Writing down your understanding of the solution is hard work and requires much reflection on how you solve the problem.
- Transforming your specific solution into a more widely applicable solution is difficult.
- People are unlikely to use a solution if you don't explain the reasons for using it.
- Writing down the solution may compromise your competitive advantage (either personal or corporate.)


### Solution:
Write down the solution using the pattern form. Capture both the problem and the solution, as well as the reasons why the solution is applicable. Apply Mandatory Elements Present to ensure that the necessary information is communicated clearly. Include Optional Elements When Helpful to capture any additional useful information. Distribute the resulting pattern to the largest audience you feel it could help that does not compromise your competitive advantage. Often, this means publishing your patterns exclusively within your company via Intranets or company journals.
