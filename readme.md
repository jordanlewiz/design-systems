# Design Systems Pattern Language

The whole concept of a styleguide is to provide clarity, but yet there is still none when we talk about the different types available. ‘Styleguide’ has become a catch-all term to describe a system to document something.

The word ‘style’ is subjective and is the reason why there is miscommunication when we talk about styleguides. Does it mean something to do with UI styles, writing styles, coding styles? It can mean all of these, or none.

A styleguide’s purpose and value is derived directly from the needs of it’s consumers, contributors and stakeholders and these needs are often unique, and to understand what a styleguide is it’s important that we first have a shared vocabulary so that we’re all on the same page.

Having recently seen Claudina Sarahe’s talk on ‘Pattern Languages’ at Clarity Conf, it has inspired me to start a styleguide pattern language to help achieve a little more clarity into what all the styleguide buzzwords mean.

**Note:**
Due to the multple nomenclatures of ‘styleguide’, ‘style guide’, ‘style-guide’, it will be refered to as `styleguide` in the pattern language to avoid spelling confusion.
